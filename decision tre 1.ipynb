In this case, metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of evaluation metric also depends on the specific business or research goal. For instance, in the medical domain, a classification model for disease diagnosis may prioritize high recall to minimize false negatives, while in fraud detection, high precision may be more important to minimize false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "To select an appropriate evaluation metric for a classification problem, it is important to consider the following factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class distribution: If the class distribution is imbalanced, accuracy may not be a suitable metric. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business/research goal: The choice of evaluation metric should align with the specific business or research goal. For example, high recall may be more important than high precision in medical diagnosis tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretability: Some evaluation metrics may be more interpretable than others. For example, accuracy is easy to interpret, while AUC (area under the ROC curve) may be more difficult to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trade-offs: Different evaluation metrics focus on different aspects of the model's performance and may have trade-offs. For example, increasing recall may come at the cost of decreasing precision, and vice versa. It is important to consider these trade-offs and choose the metric that best balances the competing priorities. \"\"\""
