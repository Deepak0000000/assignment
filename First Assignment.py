"""The characteristics of a Python tuple are:

1.Tuples are ordered, indexed collections of data. Similar to string indices, the first value in the tuple will have the index [0], the second value [1], and so on. 
2.Tuples can store duplicate values.
3.Once data is assigned to a tuple, the values cannot be changed."""
